        <h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom">What is Future Chain?</h2>

        <p>
            A Futures Chain displays real-time data of index or stock futures contracts across different expiries.
            It helps traders understand how futures participants are positioned, whether positions are being built,
            reduced, or rolled over, and what the market expects from the underlying index.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Why Do We Use the Future Chain?</h3>
        <p>
            Futures data reflects the activity of institutional and professional traders.
            By analyzing price, open interest, and volume together, traders can identify
            trend strength, direction, and conviction behind market moves.

        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Breaking Down the Future Data</h3>
        <p>
            The Futures Chain shows Nifty 50 index futures data for multiple expiries
            (Near, Next, and Far month) with continuous updates during market hours.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Column Explanation</h3>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Expiry</h4>
        <p>
            The date on which the future contract expires. Traders typically focus more on
            the near-month expiry due to higher liquidity.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Futures LTP</h4>
        <p>
            The last traded price of the futures contract.
            It often trades at a premium or discount compared to the spot index
            depending on market sentiment and cost of carry.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Change (%)</h4>
        <p>
            Shows how much the futures price has moved compared to the previous close.
            A strong positive change with rising open interest suggests aggressive long buildup.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Open Interest (OI)</h4>
        <p>
            Open Interest represents the total number of outstanding futures contracts.
            Rising OI with price increase confirms trend strength, while falling OI indicates position unwinding.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Change in OI</h4>
        <p>
            Indicates whether new positions are being added or old positions are being closed.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Price ↑ + OI ↑:</strong> Long buildup (bullish)</li>
            <li><strong>Price ↓ + OI ↑:</strong> Short buildup (bearish)</li>
            <li><strong>Price ↑ + OI ↓:</strong> Short covering</li>
            <li><strong>Price ↓ + OI ↓:</strong> Long unwinding</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Trading Insight</h3>
        <p>
            In the above example, near-month futures show rising price along with rising open interest,
            indicating fresh long positions and strong bullish participation.
            Far-month contracts showing lower OI change suggest limited positional activity.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Why Futures Chain Matters More Than Options Alone</h3>
        <p>
            Futures represent directional bets with real money commitment.
            While options can reflect hedging or speculation, futures data provides a clearer picture
            of trend strength and institutional bias.
