        <p>
            Call Open Interest (Call OI) represents the total number of outstanding call option contracts,
            while Put Open Interest (Put OI) represents the total number of outstanding put option contracts.
            These values help traders understand where market participants are placing their bets.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Why Do Traders Analyze Call OI vs Put OI?</h3>
        <p>
            Comparing Call OI and Put OI provides insight into market sentiment.
            High Call OI generally indicates resistance levels, while high Put OI indicates support levels.
            The comparison helps identify bullish, bearish, or range-bound expectations.
